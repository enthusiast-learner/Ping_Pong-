This is a CSS-only animation project where I recreated a ping-pong paddle and ball with simple HTML & CSS.

Iâ€™m currently learning and practicing CSS animation techniques, and this project helped me explore:

*@keyframes animations

*transform and rotate

*gradients and shapes with border-radius

*basic flexbox layout
